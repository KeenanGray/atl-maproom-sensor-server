# The Atlanta Map Room Sensor Server

To document and reflect upon the connections and disjunctions between civic data and lived experience in the city, through the collaborative creation of large-scale, interpretive maps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* node.js

* ubuntu vm

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

To install this script as a service on the machine, place the file "sensor_service.conf" in the `/etc/init` directory. The script will now start whenever the machine boots, and will respawn automatically. The script can be manually stopped with `stop sensor_server` and started with `start sensor_server`.
